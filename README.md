# Mega Chunt

Chatter for the masses!

## Background

Fed up with having a feeble phone, and no compatible [Chatter](http://www.chatter.com/) client from which to update the rest of the team, I set about creating Mega Chunt, a platform with a single purpose -- to create more accessible methods of chunting for the masses!

## What is this '_chunting_' you speak of?

Chunting is [our](http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/) term of endearment for the act of creating a status update on the Chatter platform.

As _tweet_ is to Twitter, so _chunt_ is to Chatter.

##Â What does Mega Chunt actually do?

Mega Chunt allows you to chunt via a few familiar interfaces: Email, IM and (currently via [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com/)) SMS.

## Who can use this?

Anyone with a [Chatter](http://www.chatter.com/) account, and a Google account.

## How do I start?

First off, [connect with your Chatter account](http://megachunt.appspot.com/authenticate).

Then you'll be granted a magical email address, __keep this email address a secret__.

Emails sent to this address will chunt on your behalf.

Additionally, if you have a GTalk account, you can chunt by IM'ing _megachunt@appspot.com_.

Lastly, this is a bit of a hack, but you can also chunt through SMS if you like. To do this, first enable the SMS channel on the awesome IFTTT service. Then, create a new [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com/) task that responds to an SMS message by emailing the message to your magic Mega Chunt email address. Simple!

## I have another question that isn't covered here!

Get in touch, and I'll do my best to answer! :)
